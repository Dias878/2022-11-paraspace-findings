## [G-01] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be markedÂ payable

For functions that are guaranteed to revert when called by normal users, such as having `onlyOwner` modifier which should only be called by the owner. Using the payable modifier can lower the gas usage for the intended caller, as it won't include additional checks for the value being sent, which results in fewer opcodes being executed and lower gas usage.
