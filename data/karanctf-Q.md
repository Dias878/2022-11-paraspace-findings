1. The `withdrawPunk()` function  in `WPunkGateway.sol` does not include any checks to ensure that the `punkIndexes` array is not empty, or that the `to` address is not the zero address. 
2. `PoolStorage.sol` contract uses the `bytes32` type for the `POOL_STORAGE_POSITION` constant, which is then converted to a `uint256` type using the `uint256()` function. This conversion is unnecessary, as the `bytes32` type can be directly used in the `keccak256()` function to calculate the storage position. Removing the unnecessary type conversion will reduce the gas usage of the contract and make the code more readable.
		   **Mitigation:** Just use `bytes32(x)`. It's as easy as that because they are both 2^256 (unlike `bytes`).
3. Use close and open interval comment when using range logic in code in multple instances with `&&`
   ```solidity
   require(
            value > MIN_AUCTION_HEALTH_FACTOR &&
                value <= MAX_AUCTION_HEALTH_FACTOR,
            Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT
        );
	```
			**Mitigation:** Write a comment which make the range more readable like
		
			//value in between (MIN_AUCTION_HEALTH_FACTOR, MAX_AUCTION_HEALTH_FACTOR]
4. Write more robust tests as most of the test written only run for 1-2 values.
5. Use latest solidity version as using the latest version of Solidity can help improve the quality and efficiency of smart contract development, as well as ensure compatibility with other tools and frameworks in the ecosystem.
