Since one can execute the line `` DataTypes.PoolStorage storage ps = poolStorage();`` in a library function, there is no need to execute it in the ``supply`` function and then pass members of the struct as arguments to the ``SupplyLogic.executeSupply`` function. These member variables of the struct can just as well be retrieved inside the ``SupplyLogic.executeSupply``., which can save gas as a result of eliminating some arguments for the function ``SupplyLogic.executeSupply``. This gas optimization can be used for other functions as well, including ``supplyERC721()``, ``supplyERC721FromNToken()``, etc.
