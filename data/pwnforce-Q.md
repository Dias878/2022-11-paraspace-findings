As per [OpenZeppelin’s (OZ) recommendation](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680/6), “The guidelines are now to make it impossible for anyone to run initialize on an implementation contract, by adding an empty constructor with the initializer modifier. So the implementation contract gets initialized automatically upon deployment.”

It is also mentioned by the [OZ Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) since the UUPS vulnerability discovery: “Additionally, we modified the code generated by the Wizard 19 to include a constructor that automatically initializes the implementation when deployed.”

Furthermore, this thwarts any attempts to frontrun the initialization of the following contract:
contracts/ui/WPunkGateway.sol:
57:  function initialize() external initializer
