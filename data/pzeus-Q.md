## Issue
In general, missing a lot of dev and not only comments that will suit greatly to all auditors, future audits or even new developers that will be potentially onboarded
Although, this does not have any impact on the protocol itself, I think this will smoothen up a lot of things in the furure
## Examples
Some examples are `SeaportAdapter.sol` and `X2Y2Adapter.sol`
Also, in a lot of cases, the function behaviour and params explanation are placed inside the interface contracts of the contracts that are implementing those functionalities. This makes the whole process uncomfortable and annoying
