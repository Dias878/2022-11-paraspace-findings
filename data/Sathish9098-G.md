##   [GAS -1]    instead of using operator && on single require or if checks . Using Multiple REQUIRE or IF checks can save more gas.

##  [GAS-2]  Use uint256 instead of uint8 . uint8 Can Increase Gas Cost. Possible to save 6 gas as per Remix IDE gas reports

  ####  A smart contract's gas consumption can be higher if developers use items that are less than 32 bytes in size because the Ethereum Virtual Machine can only handle 32 bytes at a time. In order to increase the element's size to the necessary size, the EVM has to perform additional operations.

       9:    uint8 constant MIN_ORACLES_NUM = 3;

      12:   uint128 constant EXPIRATION_PERIOD = 1800;   //21505 uint128,uint128 Execution cost   // 21493   uint256,uint256 Execution cost 

      14:   uint128 constant MAX_DEVIATION_RATE = 150;  //21505 uint128,uint128 Execution cost   // 21493   uint256,uint256 Execution cost

##   [GAS-3]  Compute known value off-chain

####   If You know what data to hash, there is no need to consume more computational power to hash it using keccak256 , youâ€™ll end up consuming 2x amount of gas.

##   [GAS-4]   FUNCTIONS GUARANTEED TO REVERT WHEN CALLED BY NORMAL USERS CAN BE MARKED PAYABLE

####    If a function modifier such as onlyOwner,onlyRole is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are CALLVALUE(2),DUP1(3),ISZERO(3),PUSH2(3),JUMPI(10),PUSH1(3),DUP1(3),REVERT(0),JUMPDEST(1),POP(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

GAS-1	Use assembly to check for address(0)	40
GAS-2	Using bools for storage incurs overhead	3
GAS-3	Cache array length outside of loop	45
GAS-4	State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage	4
GAS-5	Use calldata instead of memory for function arguments that do not get mutated	39
GAS-6	Use Custom Errors	16
GAS-7	Don't initialize variables with default value	59
GAS-8	++i costs less gas than i++, especially when it's used in for-loops (--i/i-- too)	58
GAS-9	Using private rather than public for constants, saves gas	8
GAS-10	Use shift Right/Left instead of division/multiplication if possible	2
GAS-11	Use != 0 instead of > 0 for unsigned integer comparison	23
GAS-12	internal functions not called by the contract should be removed	24
