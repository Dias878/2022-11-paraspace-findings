MULTIPLE ADDRESS/ID MAPPINGS CAN BE COMBINED INTO A SINGLE MAPPING OF AN ADDRESS/ID TO A STRUCT, WHERE APPROPRIATE
Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key’s keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation’s associated stack operations
